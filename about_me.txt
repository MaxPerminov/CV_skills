How I organize my work process:

1 - standartization - creating and using the same effective methods for similar tasks to improve speed of completing.
2 - planning - making plan that I'll be able to faster switch tasks.
3 - estimation - creating time gaps that I'll able to complete all necessary tasks.
4 - sorting - every tool, task, material should be grouped and be located in matched places for faster access.
5 - discipline - willpower to do things in way it was planned.
6 - responsibility - do the things I am supposed to do and accept the results of my actions.
