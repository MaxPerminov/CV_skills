1)what's testing

Software testing is the process of evaluating and verifying,
that a product does what it should.

2)why do we have to test software

Testing is important because it discovers defects/bugs before a product delivery
to a client, which guarantees high quality of the software. It saves money
and reputation for developers.

3)what is testing process

1. Study and analysis of the subject of testing.
2. Planning of testing.
3. Execution of testing.

4)what are main phases of STLC, what are entry and exit criteria

test analysis;
test planning;
test design;
test implementation;
test monitoring and control;
test execution;
test completion.

Entry and exit criteria - set of conditions to begin and to finish testing.
1.Entry criteria is met when test tools, testable code, test data are ready for testing.
2.Exit criteria depends on time estimated, code coverage by tests, number of founded bugs.

5)what are testing levels

unit testing
integration testing
system testing
acceptance testing

6)what are principles of testing

1. Testing shows the presence of defects, not their absence.
2. Exhaustive testing is impossible.
3. Early testing saves time and money.
4. Defects cluster together: 80 percent of defects are in 20 percent of code!
5. Pesticide Paradox: If the same tests are repeated many times, they will not find new bugs.
6. Testing is context dependent.
7. Absence-of-errors is a mistake: meeting client needs and requirements are important too, not only absence of errors.

7)do we need to test all test scenarios

If it's possible we have to test all test scenarios, but if there is no time for exhaustive testing - 
we can prioritize testing to test scenarios that are more important, and we can use different methods
of test design to reduce number of test cases.

8) at what STLC phase do I write testcases.

Test cases are written at Test case development phase.
