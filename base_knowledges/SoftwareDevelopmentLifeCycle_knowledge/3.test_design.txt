1)what test design techniques do I know

Equivalent Class Partitioning
Boundary Value Analysis
Error Guessing
Pairwise Testing
Cause/Effect Graphing(how does result depend on input)
Decision table

2)what is Equivalent Class Partitioning

for example - valid range is from 1 to 10. Thus, Equivalent Partitioning
is 0, 1 to 10, more than 10.

3)what is Boundary Value Analysis what are the values of the technique

Values near the boundary have higher chances of error.
For example - valid range is from 1 to 10. Thus, Boundary Values
are 0, 1, 10, 11. 

4)decision table

Decision table - is a table, that consists of:
1)conditions
2)rules of conditions(requirements)
3)actions (results). Action is a complex of a condition and a rule.

Example:
Cost of car insurance depends on person's experience and incidents in the past.
Decision table:
____________________________________________________
                   |        |       |       |       |
condition:         |  rule 1| rule 2| rule 3| rule 4|
___________________|________|_______|_______|_______|
1)experience       |   no   |  no   |   yes |   yes |
2)incidents in past|   yes  |  no   |   yes |   no  | 
___________________|________|_______|_______|_______|
action:                                             |
____________________________________________________|                                                
cost of insurance  |   200  |  100  |   50  |   10  |         
___________________|________|_______|_______|_______|
