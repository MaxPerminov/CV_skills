1)why do we need test documentation; types of it

It provides testers with reliable data to plan and execute.
It coordinates the development team:
0.User cases and check list.
1.Master plan.
2.Test plan.
3.Requirement traceability matrix(RTM).
4.Test suit.
5.Test scenario(any capability, that can be evaluated).
6.Test case.
7.Test execution report.
8.Bug report.

2)what is testplan, what are elements of test plan

Test plan is a document. It contains objectives, resources, and processes of product testing.
IEEE 829:
Ð°) Test plan identifier;
b) Introduction;
c) Test items;
d) Features to be tested;
e) Features not to be tested;
f) Approach;
g) Item pass / fail criteria;
h) Suspension criteria and resumption requirements;
i) Test deliverables;
j) Testing tasks;
k) Environmental needs;
l) Responsibilities;
m) Staffing and training needs;
n) Schedule;
o) Risks and contingencies;
p) Approvals.

It is important because all high-level scenarios, business requirements and estimates
are situated in one place

3)what's Traceability Matrix

Traceability Matrix - is a table, that shows how requirements are covered by testcases.
In rows are situated test cases, in columns - requirements. 
Intersection cell shows if requirement is covered by a testcase.

4) what is the difference between checklist and testcase

The Checklist consists of a list, every item of which points at what must be tested.
Test case points at what must be tested, but contains detailed instruction
(preconditions, steps, results).

5) what are test case attributes

1. Unique ID
2. Summary
3. Preconditions
4. Description:
-steps to reproduce with an expected result

6)what are user stories and acceptance criteria

User story - explanation of a software feature written from the perspective of the customer.
User story scheme: As a <role> I want <functionality> so that <benefit> 
User story Example: As a user I want to have access to write letter function, so that I can
write letters
User story divides into acceptance Criteria - basis for checklist
-Acceptance Criteria 1: As a user I want to have ability to choose letter recipient,
so that I can write letters to concrete people
-Acceptance Criteria 2: As a user I want to have ability to send mp3 files, so that I can send
 music
-Acceptance Criteria 3: As a user I want to have ability to choose 7 letter recipients at
once, so that I can write one letter, not seven

7)what is the basis for checklist

the basis for checklist is product requirements
